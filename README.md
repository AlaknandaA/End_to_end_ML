# End_to_end_ML
my first end to end ML project with Muskaan

[@Project reference](https://www.crio.do/projects/python-forecasting-stocks-dash/)

Let's do it!

Topics to be covered:
- Dash python
- Regression based ML
- Real-time data fetching: `yfinance` 
- Python visualizations: `plotly` 
- Stock market analysis 
- Deployment: Heroku
- Web dev: HTML & CSS

File structure is as follows:
- `app.py` contains web layout and server function. We will be referring to it as our main file.
- `model.py` is where we will implement a machine learning model for forecasting the stock price.
- The `assets` folder is where we keep our CSS files for styling and any other miscellaneous files like images (if u wish to include it in your site)
- `requirements.txt` is created so that other developers can install the correct versions of the required Python packages to run your Python code.
- The `Procfile` is created for deployment using Heroku. It is not needed to run the app locally.
